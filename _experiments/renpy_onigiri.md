Set in a charming Onigiri café, this story invites players into a world where rice balls come to life — each with a unique flavor, personality, and a quiet longing to be understood. Through playful dialogue and tender moments, Onigiri no Kokoro explores themes of identity, self-worth, and the power of choice.

Each onigiri character carries a history shaped by their time at Onigiri School, where expectations and stereotypes often clouded their sense of self. As they await their next customer, doubts bubble to the surface: Is a plain rice onigiri too boring? Do all cats really love salmon? What happens when someone chooses you for something you never expected?

It’s a gentle story about being seen, being different, and finding comfort in your own flavor even when the world tells you otherwise.
