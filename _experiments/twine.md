As part of my DH530 project, I wanted to share a personal journey, one that captures the language barriers and quiet struggles of being an international student.

Studying abroad was never something I thought I had the courage to do. But when life opened a door â€” or maybe shoved me through it â€” I took the leap. And Iâ€™m so glad I didâœ¨
It wasnâ€™t easy. It was uncomfortable, sometimes awkward, and often overwhelming. But it changed me in ways I couldnâ€™t have imagined.

Thatâ€™s why I wanted to document it here. Because "struggle" isnâ€™t always a bad word. Itâ€™s part of growing. Itâ€™s part of becoming.
And itâ€™s okay to feel out of place! To be embarrassed. Because the next time? Youâ€™ll be stronger. Youâ€™ll know a little more. And it wonâ€™t feel quite so scaryðŸ˜Ž
