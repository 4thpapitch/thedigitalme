A cozy yet emotionally layered visual novel created in Ren'Py. Set in an Onigiri café, this story explores themes of identity, taste, and belonging through the eyes of rice ball characters with distinct flavors and personalities. Each onigiri has a past shaped by their experiences at Onigiri School—and each is trying to find pride in what makes them different.
