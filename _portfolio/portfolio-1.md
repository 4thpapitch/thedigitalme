A digital archive project using Omeka to document and preserve the cultural significance of Thai amulets. This project explores their spiritual and historical importance, aiming to make these artifacts accessible to a global audience. I designed an interactive platform that showcases various amulet types, their meanings, and the practices surrounding them, providing both educational value and cultural insight.
