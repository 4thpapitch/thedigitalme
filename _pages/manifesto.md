### Shifting My Understanding
Through the process of making, I had to intentionally embed my own meaning, purpose, and emotions into the work. This changed the way I think about both media and research. I became more critical and curious—not just asking what something is, but why it exists, and how it’s trying to communicate. I realized that even things that seem broken, simple, or “just for fun” are full of intention.

### Reimagining Games
I used to see games as purely recreational—something to enjoy and then move on from. But that perspective has changed. Games can be powerful tools that shape our thoughts, our values, and our relationships. In my interactive storytelling course, I was introduced to small digital tools that encouraged me to create instead of just consume. And that changed everything.

I used to think of games as something purely for fun—an escape, a way to relax. While they still offer that, I’ve come to see that games are so much more. They can shape how we think, how we see the world, and how we interact with people and ideas. Through my interactive storytelling course, I was introduced to digital tools that encouraged me to make rather than just play. That experience changed everything. I realized that games don’t have to be high-budget, large-scale productions to have meaning. Seeing the work of indie game makers inspired me deeply. Their courage to create—sometimes with nothing but a story and a simple tool—made me rethink what games can be. It reminded me that anyone can make something valuable, even if it’s small, strange, or personal. And that’s exactly the kind of making I want to see it grow.

### Expanding What Counts as Research

In traditional research, there's often a pressure to normalize—to gather data from many participants, to generalize results, and to avoid bias by aiming for neutrality. But I’ve come to see that this kind of "objectivity" can still carry deep-rooted biases, especially in who gets represented and whose voices are left out.

Through making, I’ve learned that it’s okay—and even necessary—to focus on the small scale. A single perspective, a personal story, a one-person project can be just as powerful as a large study. These intimate, specific works might not speak for everyone, but they speak to something real. They make space for nuance, complexity, and lived experience. I now believe research doesn’t always have to be polished, unified, or large to be meaningful. Sometimes, it’s the raw and personal that speaks the loudest.

As a result, my approach to research has shifted from being purely analytical and structured to something more experimental, open, and nonlinear. Making taught me to think with my hands, to explore through iteration, and to be okay with uncertainty. I’m now more interested in what media does—how it feels, how it’s experienced—than just what it means on paper.

### Future work and research

By making, I’ve realized that every creation carries intention—whether it's polished, messy, or somewhere in between. When I have to embody my own purpose and meaning into a project, I become more aware of the why behind each decision. This awareness has changed how I approach research. I now see media not just as content to analyze, but as something made—with choices, constraints, and values embedded in it. Even a glitchy, imperfect piece communicates something. This shift has moved me away from a purely traditional, theoretical way of working toward something more open, experimental, and non-linear. I think making has loosened the boundaries of what research can be—less formal, more curious, and more alive.
