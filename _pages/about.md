I come from a strong humanities background, with a deep passion for language, culture, and storytelling. After years of dedicated study in Japanese, I achieved fluency—but then I began to wonder, what’s next? That question led me to the world of data and technology. Through Digital Humanities, I discovered how different disciplines could come together. I learned how to teach data to speak, how to listen to what it reveals on its own, and how to design meaningful ways for it to communicate with others. Whatever the data category is, I believe every detail carries a story worth sharing—that’s where the intersection of humanities and computation works at its best.

About me
------
I’m Papitchaya Boonmasuvaran (Fourth, usually go by this nickname), a Digital Humanities graduate with a passion for language, culture, and technology. After studying Japanese language and culture, I explored the power of data and programming in my master’s degree. Now, I blend my humanities background with technical skills to turn data into meaningful stories and insights. I’m excited to continue growing at the intersection of culture and computation.

Background in Language and Culture studies
------
During my bachelor’s studies in Language and Culture, I focused on Japanese language acquisition—both inside and outside the classroom. Living in Japan immersed me in the language and culture in ways that went beyond textbooks. It was a meaningful experience that allowed me to engage deeply with a society known for its uniqueness and strong cultural identity. Through coursework, I expanded my understanding of intercultural communication, English pedagogy, and second language acquisition theories. I also explored broader topics that sparked my curiosity, including psychology, gender studies, and digital media. Some of my favorite classes examined social issues in Japan, gender inequality, and the political influence of digital platforms. My time there helped me build a strong foundation in the humanities, and it continues to shape how I view the world today.

Where Code Meets Culture: My Journey into Digital Humanities
------
Building on my humanities foundation, I pursued a master’s degree in Digital Humanities—where I discovered my passion for coding, data, and programming languages. I became deeply fascinated by how powerful technical tools can be, and how they can simplify complex problems and ease real-world challenges. But this degree wasn’t just about learning how to use technology—it taught me how to adapt it to serve the humanities. I learned how digital systems function, what happens behind the scenes, and how their use can create both meaningful benefits and critical social questions. This experience strengthened my enthusiasm to grow a career in data and analysis—where I can work closely with data, learn how to speak to it, and understand how it wants to be spoken to. That’s the beginning of my journey forward.

Current Focus/Career goals
------
Currently exploring roles in data management, analytics and consulting roles, where I can combine technical tools with human-centered thinking to solve real-world problems.
